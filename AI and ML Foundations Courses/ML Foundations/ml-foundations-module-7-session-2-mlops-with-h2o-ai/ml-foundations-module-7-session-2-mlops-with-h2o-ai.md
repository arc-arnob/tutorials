# ML Foundations: Module 7 Session 2: MLOps with H2O.ai

### Objective
In this assignment, you will complete an H2O.ai's Model Deployment related tutorial using the Enterprise automated machine learning platform, [Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/) and also [H2O MLOps](https://www.h2o.ai/resources/product-brief/h2o-mlops/). We will build a machine learning model using a predictive maintenance dataset, and we will explore some of the options to deploy completed models. 

**Note: This tutorial has been built on Aquarium, which is H2O.ai's cloud environment providing software access for workshops, conferences, and training. The labs in Aquarium have datasets, experiments, projects, and other content preloaded.**
 
### Prerequisites
