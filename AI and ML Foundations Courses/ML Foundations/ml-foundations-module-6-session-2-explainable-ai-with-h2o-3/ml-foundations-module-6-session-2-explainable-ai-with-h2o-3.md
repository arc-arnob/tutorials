# ML Foundations: Module 6 Session 2: Explainable AI with H2O-3

### Objective

In this assignment, you will go through the H2O-3 [model explainability toolkit tutorial](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/explainability/Explain-wine.ipynb). At the time of writing, the model explainability toolkit is relatively new and there is no lab in Aquarium with the new model explainability notebooks (we are working on it). For now, please follow the steps as shown in the tutorial notebook and find the answers for quiz questions. 

**Note: You can also install H2O-3 version 3.32 (or above) and try out the new model explainability toolkit on your machine. Getting your hands dirty is the best way of learning data science! Follow the instructions [here](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/latest_stable.html).**

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Statistics

### Task 1: Model Explainability Tutorial

1\. Check out the tutorial notebook on GitHub: [https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/explainability/Explain-wine.ipynb](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/explainability/Explain-wine.ipynb)

2\. Go through all the steps and make sure you are familiar with the new functions like explain(...) and explain_row(...). More importantly, try to understand the differences between global explanations and local explanations.

3\. The questions for the quiz for Module 6: Session 2 will be derived from the tutorial as well as the slides from the live session.


**Note: For simplicity reasons, we are using the Python version of the tutorial for this task. For R users, the model explainability toolkit is also available in R (see the RMarkdwon version [here](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/explainability/Explain-wine.Rmd)).**


### Next Steps

You can now take the **quiz** for **Module 6 Session 2**.
