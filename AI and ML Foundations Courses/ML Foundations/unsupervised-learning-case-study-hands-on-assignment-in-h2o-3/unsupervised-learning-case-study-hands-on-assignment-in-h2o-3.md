## Unsupervised Learning Case Study Hands-On Assignment in H2O-3

### Objective

This is the hands-on exercise wherein you are required to complete a case study pertaining to Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forests using H2O-3.

For this assignment, you will be using the [credit card data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains information on various properties of credit card transactions. 

**Note: This tutorial has been built on Aquarium, which is H2O.ai's cloud environment providing software access for workshops, conferences, and training. The labs in Aquarium have datasets, experiments, projects, and other content preloaded. If you use your version of H2O-3 or Driverless AI, you will not see preloaded content.**

### Task 4: Import the Credit Card Dataset 

We will be using the [credit card data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains information on various properties of credit card transactions. There are 492 fraudulent and 284,807 genuine transactions, which makes the target class highly imbalanced. We will not use the label during the anomaly detection modelling, but we will use it during the evaluation of our anomaly detection.

1.  Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and then Enter the following in the next available cell and run it to bring in the credit card data. 

~~~python
#Import the dataset
credit_card = h2o.import_file('https://github.com/nsethi31/Kaggle-Data-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/raw/master/creditcard.csv')
~~~

### Task 5: Train the isolation forest model

There are multiple approaches to an unsupervised anomaly detection problem that try to exploit the differences between the properties of common and unique observations. The idea behind the Isolation Forest is as follows.

- We start by building multiple decision trees such that the trees isolate the observations in their leaves. Ideally, each leaf of the tree isolates exactly one observation from your data set. The trees are being split randomly. We assume that if one observation is similar to others in our data set, it will take more random splits to perfectly isolate this observation, as opposed to isolating an outlier.

- For an outlier that has some feature values significantly different from the other observations, randomly finding the split isolating it should not be too hard. As we build multiple isolation trees, hence the isolation forest, for each observation we can calculate the average number of splits across all the trees that isolate the observation. The average number of splits is then used as a score, where the less splits the observation needs, the more likely it is to be anomalous.

Now train your isolation forest. The last column (index 30) of the data contains the class label, so exclude it from the training process.

~~~python
seed = 12345 # For reproducability of the experiment
ntrees = 100 #Specify the number of Trees
isoforest = H2OIsolationForestEstimator( ntrees=ntrees, seed=seed)
# Specify x as a vector containing the names or indices of the predictor variables to use when building the model.
isoforest.train(x=credit_card.col_names[0:30], training_frame=credit_card)
~~~

### Task 6: A look at the model’s predictions

Have a look at the predictions.

~~~python
predictions = isoforest.predict(credit_card)

predictions
~~~

You will see that the `prediction h2o frame` contains two columns: `predict` showing a normalized anomaly score and `mean_length` showing the average number of splits across all trees to isolate the observation. These two columns should have the property of inverse proportion by their definition, as the less random splits you need to isolate the observation, the more anomalous it is. You can easily check that by :
 
~~~python 
predictions.cor()
~~~
 
### Task 7: Predicting Anomalies using Quantile

As we formulated this problem in an unsupervised fashion, how do we go from the average number of splits / anomaly score to the actual predictions? Using a threshold! If we have an idea about the relative number of outliers in our dataset, we can find the corresponding quantile value of the score and use it as a threshold for our predictions.

~~~python 
quantile = 0.95
quantile_frame = predictions.quantile([quantile])
quantile_frame
~~~

We can use the threshold to predict the anomalous class.

~~~python 
threshold = quantile_frame[0, "predictQuantiles"]
predictions["predicted_class"] = predictions["predict"] > threshold
predictions["class"] = credit_card["Class"]
predictions
~~~

### Task 8: Evaluation

Because the isolation forest is an unsupervised method, it makes sense to have a look at the classification metrics that are not dependent on the prediction threshold and give an estimate of the quality of scoring. Two such metrics are Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Area under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUCPR).

`AUC` is a metric evaluating how well a binary classification model distinguishes true positives from false positives. The perfect AUC score is 1; the baseline score of a random guessing is 0.5.

`AUCPR` is a metric evaluating the precision recall trade-off of a binary classification using different thresholds of the continuous prediction score. The perfect AUCPR score is 1; the baseline score is the relative count of the positive class.

For highly imbalanced data, AUCPR is recommended over AUC as the AUCPR is more sensitive to True positives, False positives and False negatives, while not caring about True negatives, which in large quantity usually overshadow the effect of other metrics.

def get_auc(labels, scores):
    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(labels, scores)

def get_aucpr(labels, scores):
    precision, recall, th = precision_recall_curve(labels, scores)
    aucpr_score = np.trapz(recall, precision)
    return precision, recall, aucpr_score

    ax.plot(x, y, style, label=plot_label)
    ax.legend()
    
    ax.set_ylabel(x_label)
    ax.set_xlabel(y_label)

    if axes is None:
        axes = [plt.subplot(1, 2, 1), plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)]
 
    fpr, tpr, auc_score = get_auc(labels, predicted_score)
    plot_metric(axes[0], fpr, tpr, "False positive rate",
                "True positive rate", "{} AUC = {:.4f}".format(info, auc_score))
    if plot_baseline:
        plot_metric(axes[0], [0, 1], [0, 1], "False positive rate",
                "True positive rate", "baseline AUC = 0.5", "r--")
 
    precision, recall, aucpr_score = get_aucpr(labels, predicted_score)
    plot_metric(axes[1], recall, precision, "Recall",
                "Precision", "{} AUCPR = {:.4f}".format(info, aucpr_score))
    if plot_baseline:
        thr = sum(labels)/len(labels)
        plot_metric(axes[1], [0, 1], [thr, thr], "Recall",
                "Precision", "baseline AUCPR = {:.4f}".format(thr), "r--")
 
    plt.show()
    return axes
 
 
def figure():
    fig_size = 4.5
    f = plt.figure()
    f.set_figheight(fig_size)
    f.set_figwidth(fig_size*2)
 
 
h2o_predictions = predictions.as_data_frame()
 
figure()
axes = prediction_summary(
    h2o_predictions["class"], h2o_predictions["predict"], h2o_predictions["predicted_class"], "h2o")
