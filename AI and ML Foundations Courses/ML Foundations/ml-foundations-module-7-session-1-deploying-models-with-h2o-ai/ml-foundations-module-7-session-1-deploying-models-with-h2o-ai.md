# ML Foundations: Module 7 Session 1: Deploying Models with H2O.ai

### Objective


In this assignment, you will complete three of [H2O.ai's](https://www.h2o.ai/) Model Deployment related tutorials using the Enterprise automated machine learning platform, [Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/).  We will build a machine learning model using a predictive maintenance dataset, and we will explore some of the options to deploy completed models. 

**Note: This tutorial has been built on Aquarium, which is H2O.ai's cloud environment providing software access for workshops, conferences, and training. The labs in Aquarium have datasets, experiments, projects, and other content preloaded. If you use your version of H2O-3 or Driverless AI, you will not see preloaded content.**


### Prerequisites


- Basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Statistics

- An [Aquarium](https://aquarium.h2o.ai/) account to access H2O.ai’s software on the AWS Cloud. 
   - Need an [Aquarium](https://aquarium.h2o.ai/) account? Follow the instructions in the next section **Task 1** to create an account
 
**Note: Aquarium's Driverless AI lab has a license key built-in, so you don't need to request one to use it. Each Driverless AI lab instance will be available to you for two hours, after which it will terminate. No work will be saved. If you need more time to further explore Driverless AI, you can always launch another lab instance or reach out to our sales team via the [contact us form](https://www.h2o.ai/company/contact/).**
